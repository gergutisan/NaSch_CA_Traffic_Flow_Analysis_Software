Define Clusterability

Similar cluster size and number BUT different survival time. 

Moving average plots.

The survival time, however, gives us a key insight into the nature of the clusters formed in these different AV models.

What survival time means and why certain model have higher survival time than others. Refer lane change dynamics here and P(Av-av)

P(AV-AV) tendency of AV to seek out and follow another AV

LANE CHANGE DYNAMICS:
Low density:hvLaneChangeRank -> b1, b2, na, o, nao 
Low density:avLaneChangeRateRank -> oppo and nao same, bh and na same, base least
total lane change: same rank as avLCRR

Crit density:hvLaneChangeRateRank -> bh > b > oppo = na > nao
Crit density:avLaneChangeRateRank -> oppo = nap ~ bh > na > b
Total lane change: bh > oppo = b > na > nao
Numbers for nao extremely low


Concept of intelligent regime dependent mobility/ behaviour







Deeper analysis of Low Density

EXPERIMENT 2!

Include timestep and density relation


Implications:
NAO: saves travel fuel for everyone, more safe, better for traffic
