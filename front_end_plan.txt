Front end simulations deals with two things:

    i) Setting up the sim case (i.e. trafficGenerator.py, case.py, simulationManager.py)
    ii) Setting up the different AV models 

Variables in sim:

    1) Steady state
    2) Increasing density
    3) AV models
    4) Road geometry
    5) Car color?
    6) Advanced models: setting up traffic lights, speed breakers and bottlenecks 

Purpose of the GUI:
    
    Take input from the user to start the custom simulation. After simulation is over, create the analysis graphs 

User inputs:
    1) all vars needed for sim
    2) directory needed for saving raw data and analysis plots 
    
Note for myself:
    > Need to make directory general in plotter files and the GUI

Plan for the front end:

> Take inputs for case.py from the GUI
> Save all the user input parameters as var in the gui.py code
> alter all the python code with the user input parameters using the read, replace and write methods.
    >> make sure to start the python codes from default mode 
> run the sim case after taking the inputs
    >> change nagel.py/simulationManager.py to make sure that all the altered code is set back to default after the simulation is over
        >>> use comments in nagel.py to store all the default/changed values to do it
